# Nussinov_Jacobson
**Overview**

This project implements the Nussinov algorithm for RNA secondary structure prediction. The Nussinov algorithm is a dynamic programming approach that determines the optimal secondary structure by maximizing the number of base pairs in a given RNA sequence.

**Usage**

Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Running the Script

Save the RNA sequence in the script or provide it during runtime.

Run the nussinov.py script.

The script will prompt you to enter an RNA sequence or press 1 to use the default sequence.

The script will output the paired bases and the corresponding dot-bracket notation.
